# Capstone_Project
Additional project to supplement the assigned coursework that will showcase our application development skills

Proposal:
Build a mobile first application that field technicians can utilize on a tablet.  This application will get information from multiple APIs to help companies plan their deployment of personnel and make their jobs more efficient through these application features:

1. Utilize the Petroleum Data Application Program Interface(or USGS API) to get wellsite data and store it for the current project.
2. Utilize the google maps API to give them directions to the desired location along with directions and finding nearest hotels, restaurants, stores.
3. Be able to select their division withing the company to pull up relevant field sheets to input key information for their project.
4. Utilize weather API to gather data at the times they are on location.
5. The app will also have a checklist so that they take the required equipment with them and in essence "check it out" and update the inventory system that took it with them. This includes equipment, vehicle, tools, etc.
6. Allow them to utilize the tablets camera to take pictures and store them for the specific project.  
7. Obtain client signatures of work completed.  Can include the actual field ticket(quote) and or report of work completed.  
8. When it is all said and done, once proper wifi and or signal is available, the application will generate a report and email it to all relevant parties at their designated email.
9. Update to the company's server in real time so that the progress of a project can be verified by a supervisor or field coordinator.
10. Allow the user to make daily reports on the progress or staus of a project.  Document any issues, delays and fill out a job progress survey that can be saved an analyzed to make future projects more efficient.

This application can be tailored to any company or industry that operates in the same manner.  Anyone that utilizes DOT regulations or makes technical visits to remote locations.  It can evolve and be updated as needed.
